[Music Hacker - S2E6 - Trance Melodies in LMMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3rIduNXSgs).
Really well explained technique for creating (upbeat) trance melodies. Based on a basic chord progression, with transition notes to create a motif, then basing the supersaw bass+melody on that. Using alternating. Nice sounding SuperSaw synth. This style could be used for EBM.

[Music Hacker - S2E5 - vocals, samples, loops, and autotuning in LMMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSqorcfHgxc&t=845s).The vocoder with whitenoise input can be used to morph vocals for a harsh EBM sound.

Best practice: Each instrument/voice should be on its own effects channel, for easy mixing.

[Fl Studio Tutorial: EBM or Darkwave PT 1](https://youtu.be/iEJR2i9orDs?t=63).
Using a arpeggiator with a trance lead to get an interesting sound out of simple chord progressions.

[How to get harsh electro aggrotech vocals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSwJRtn5jd8).

Using a filter chain with compressor, pitchshift, delay, distortion/overdrive.

[Music Hacker - S2E4 - Vocal effects and processing in Audacity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQW358Ikh8s).
First normalize to near-max amplitude.
Leave a good amount of no-sound recording before and after the recording. Use this as the noise profile and remove using Denoise.
Use select and apply Amplitude effect to bring up lower volume utterances. Then trim exactly to just the vocal parts.
Also showing how to creating more interesting, or backing-like vocals sounds by duplicating the track,
and slightly offsetting the time some clicks, and changing the pitch by couple of semitones

[How To Make Synthpop P1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI21J9WtsMk). Not very synthpopy, more chillwave.
Using a bit of shared effects on drums to make them more cohesive. Compressor+EQ.
Very nice easy synth created by a squarewave one octave down, then a saw at normal octave, with a mildly resonant lowpass.
Baseline basically just repeated 16ths on same note. Started with single note, then after creating some melody move it to follow a chord progression with some walking. 
Side-chaining the bassline by the drums to make it a bit clearer.
Really nice visualization tools in FL Studio on the Parametric Equalizer and Limiter,
where current sound is overlayed into.

[Sound like Deadmau5 with LMMS](https://youtu.be/zDjkhdUPJ74?t=641).
Shows how to do side-chain compressor thing in LMMS. Otherwise not so interesting.

[Making an Industrial/Aggrotech Track - PART 4 (BASSLINE)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD_xhZdyzKU). Nice synth sound.
Mentions that the bassline is typically on the off-beat (from the kick).
Bassline with a semitone raise at the end of loop is a common sound. Or alternatively drop down.
Using two layers of saw/Supersaw primarily. But also using a smooth sine at the way low end.

[FL Studio: Melodies & Bassline + Theory = Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQZf8Aa1zs).
Minor scale common in electronic music.
Simple loop of a chord progression using 3 notes over 4 measures. Mentions that half-measure end of loop is common.
First creating chords for the melody based on the progression. Can be as simple as same chord all the time!
Then split/replace with notes of that being played independently to create a base motif. Then create variations.
In LMMS pianoroll, have to right-click on the keyboard.

[Mixing in LMMS 1: Gain Staging ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kdbwnay8R8).
Set individual instruments/FX channels to a low base volume, then adjust their relative volumes with low volume.
Then can bring the volume up to desired level with the master level, or using a maximizer.

[Mixing in LMMS 2: Compression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDl7j-mKMHc).
Making the onset of percussion very clear with a compressor with a low threshold and very high ratio (basically a limiter), with an attack (ignoring) delay. So that first onset is not limited by the compressor, but rest is.

[Mixing in LMMS 3: Panning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2iWR-YOpjY).
Basic to 'widen' the sound: Pan one instrument slight to left, and another similar instrument to the right.

[ANGELSPIT Blipvert #1 : Writing Lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYDjNKESS5A).

Very standard: aaaa, abab.
abcb. 1,2,3 does not rhyhme, 4 rhymes with 2. "works best when rhyme goes for 4,8 or 16 bars"

[ANGELSPIT Blipvert #2 : Songwriting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bmkz-wIlOG8)
"cant think of anything to go with your brilliant riff [chorus]? Take that riff and simplify it and call it a verse.
so that the verse and the chorus riff are basically the same, but one is more simplified. Example: "

[Angelspit BLIPVERT: Lyric Content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClWne9Xh_i8).
"don't write about the act, write about the mood surrounding the act"
"write about the feeling itself, but without saying 'I feel..'"
Kind-of a show,don't tell.
"Remember: the best writing partner already exists, within the audiences head.
If you describe the shadow of a monster, the audience will imagine something
probably more horrifying than you can ever describe"

"the verses are the questions. They are setting up the background story.
Chorus is like the punchline. Its the resolutions, answers, and twists
to all the confusion you express in the verses"
"start the chorus with a big Major chord. This will add power.
Especially if writing dark, angry music"

"chorus lyrics are the most important part of a song.
You need a *short, memorable hook*. I got two ultimate tests for a chorus:
1) say the chorus twice to a friend.
If they can remember it after two hours, then its good.
If they can remember it the next morning, then it is a hit"
2) imagine a pub..drunken people..singing around a piano. BADLY..
Can you imagine them singing your chorus? If no, simplify it.

[Terror EBM lead tutorial - "The Terror Swap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnWASjepnM8).
Synth lead starts with has notes on the downbeat, then swapping to be on the offbeat.
Changing roughly every 1 measure. Ending the section on the downbeat normally.
Can fill in the 'gaps' by adding notes at the root.
These notes can be moved to follow along the chord progression (or be contra).

Also taking super basic pattern of 4 notes. Duplicating and then trying to offset 
at different locations to 'find' interesting rhythms.

[Creating Audio Textures that Groove Tutorial - Breath & Decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3S3k4c4dHI).

Bringing it down an octave or two too make it less speech and more abstract.
Also using swaps of effect presets for each measure to add some more motion in the sound.

[How to get harsh EBM or Industrial Vocals in FL Studio (or any DAW, really)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLlM3P5SE1g).
Pitch Shifter - Distortion - Delay - Reverb.
Pitch shifting by multiple. -1 semitone, -2 semitone, -3.

with lots of reverbs, compression to keep dynamics steady. First starting with 'tonal' parts, along a chord progression.
Using percussion samples, stretching and tuning them down to form bassline.
Using environmental sounds, like waves of water, cars passing to place the listener somewhere else. 


[Serum Tutorial - Ambient Drone Pro Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtgMa3nDJD8).

# Lyrics

## Ideas

Fame is a #falseauthority
Celebrity
Kind-of a pyramid scheme.
To become famous, support people who already are famous (making them famous)
Narrow unrepresentative selection from groups (ex: 'actors') distorts peoples beliefs.
"actors earn a lot of money".
People seeking fame willing to work for not-so-much-money,
believing it will come in the future.
Exploited/abused
Lottery.

Cult of personality
'famous for being famous'
'15 minutes of fame' Warhol/Finkenstein
Banksy: 'In the future everyone will be anonymous for fifteen minutes'




Selling shovels at the goldrush
Becoming rich by supplying neccesities (real or preceived) to
people seeking to become rich (often by longshots)
Playing people

## Themes
Manipulation of people
Psychology, the mind. Perception
'how we see the world'

Human experience. Finding the core
'things that stay the same'

## Quotes

"We don't know who struck first, us or them, but we know that it was us that scorched the sky."

Morpheous, The Matrix

```
Let me tell you why you're here. You're here because you know something.
What you know you can't explain, but you feel it.
You've felt it your entire life, that there's something wrong with the world.
You don't know what it is, but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.
It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about?
(The Matrix)
...
(The Matrix) is everywhere
...
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. 
...
(That) you are a slave, Neo.
Like everyone else you were born into bondage.
Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch.
A prison for your mind.
